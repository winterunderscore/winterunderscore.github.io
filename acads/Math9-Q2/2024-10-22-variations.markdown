## Direct Variation <a name="direct"></a>

Direct variation produces pairs of two numbers in which their **ratio remains constant**.

The formula used to describe direct variation is as follows:  
$$
\begin{gather*}
y = kx, \\
\text{where $k$ is the constant of variation}
\end{gather*}
$$
where $k$ is the constant of variation

It can be phrased as the following:  

- $y$ varies directly as $x$
- $y$ is directly proportional to $x$
- $y$ is proportional to $x$

Using this formula, we can derive the formulas for the other variables, $k$ and $x$:  
$$k = \frac{y}{x}$$
$$x = \frac{y}{k}$$  

For two quantities $x$ and $y$, an **increase** in $x$ results in an **increase** in $y$ and vice versa.

### Exercises <a name="direct-exercises"></a>

1. Given that $x$ varies directly as $y$ and $x = 35$ when $y = 7$, solve the folowing questions
    a. What is the constant of variation $k$?
    b. What is the value of $y$ when $x = 25$?
    c. What is the value of $x$ when $y = 9$?

## Inverse Variation <a name="inverse"></a>

Inverse variation produces pairs of two numbers whose **product is constant**.

The formula used to describe inverse variation is as follows:  
$$
\begin{gather*}
y = \frac{k}{x}, \\
\text{where $k$ is the constant of variation}
\end{gather*}
$$

It can be phrased as: $y$ varies inversely as $x$

Using this formula, we can derive the formulas for the other variables, $k$ and $x$:  
$$k = xy$$
$$x = \frac{k}{y}$$

For two quantities $x$ and $y$, an **increase** in $x$ results in a **decrease** in $y$ and vice versa.

## Joint Variation <a name="joint"></a>

Joint variation is similar to direct variation, except it **involves more than 2 variables**.

The formula used to describe joint variation is as follows:  
$$
\begin{gather*}
a = kbc, \\
\text{where $k$ is the constant of variation}
\end{gather*}
$$

It can be phrased as: $x$ varies jointly as $b$ and $c$

Using this formula, we can derive the formulas for the other variables, $k$, $b$ and $c$  
$$k = \frac{a}{bc}$$
$$b = \frac{a}{kc}$$
$$c = \frac{a}{kb}$$

For three quantities $a$, $b$ and $c$, an **increase** in either one of them results in an **increase in the other two**.

## Combined Variation <a name="combined"></a>

Combined variation **combines both direct and inverse variations**, thus the name.

The formula used to describe combined variation is as follows:  
$$
\begin{gather*}
t = \frac{kx}{y}, \\
\text{where $k$ is the constant of variation}
\end{gather*}
$$
It can phrased as: $t$ varies directly as $x$ and inversely as $y$

Using this, we can derive the formulas for the other variables, $k$, $x$ and $y$  
$$k = \frac{ty}{x}$$
$$x = \frac{ty}{k}$$
$$y = \frac{kx}{t}$$

For three quantities, $t$, $x$ and $y$:

- an **increase** in $x$ results in an **increase** in $t$
- a **decrease** in $x$ results in a **decrease** in $t$
- an **increase** in $y$ results in a **decrease** in $t$
- a **decrease** in $y$ results in an **increase** in $t$
